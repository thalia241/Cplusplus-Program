 // The project that I have posted is for an inventory tracking system for a grocery store called Corner Grocer. It allows the user to search for items, tracks the number of times that items has been purchased, or creates a histogram using asterisks as numeric values. This program uses the input file to gather the data and returns the frequency.dat file.
I am very proud of the work that I did. Creating a project with no errors, working as instructed and fully operational, especially if hours of debugging was involved, is something to do a victory dance for. 
I may be able to enhance my code by adding extra error handling or adding features that would also work well in an inventory tracking system. 
I found that the most challenging part of this assignment was figuring out which parts of the code went into which files and what I needed to make sure was incorporated into my main .cpp file. To overcome this, I went through past assignments, Zybooks, as well as trusty YouTube for support when needed. 
I believe that the skills used in this project will be necessary in absolutely every other project that I do, especially if it is a C++ language. I learned how to use multiple files to create a structured program, how to use standard coding methods to keep code organized, error free, and how important it is to incorporate error handling and debugging into your coding process. 
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the code organized and using in-line comments when needed to explain the code.
